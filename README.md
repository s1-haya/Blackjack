## Installation
git clone "https://github.com/s1-haya/Blackjack.git" Blackjack<br>
cd Blackjack<br>
npm start<br>
"http://localhost:8080/" <- click + CMD<br>

## Usage
This is a competitive game between the casino dealer and the player.<br>
If the player's card total is closer to 21 than the casino dealer’s, the player wins the game and receives a payout. However, if the player's card total exceeds 21 points, the player loses the game.<br>

## Why
Recursion Challenges<br>
To acquire knowledge of the following<br>
● software design<br>
● Typescript and OOP Practice<br>
● MVC Architecture<br>

## How
The following order
1 Model Design
(debug)
2 Front design
(debug)
3 View, Controller
(debug)

## Difficulty Points
At first, the model structure of blackjack was not clear to me. So I had to figure out the whole thing by writing it down on paper, being aware of why.<br>
It was very hard to find bugs, and I had to spend about a day setting up typescript debugging from the middle of the project.<br>
In the end, I set up typescript debugging from the beginning and checked the code I wrote for each class.<br>

## Future
● Content of feedback from others<br>
● Save result data<br>
● Poker Games<br>
